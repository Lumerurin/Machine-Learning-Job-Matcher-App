Q1,Tell me about yourself.,"A concise summary that highlights relevant education/experience and demonstrates enthusiasm. Example: 'I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science, built several full-stack projects using React and Node, and interned at a small startup where I shipped features that improved onboarding completion by 12%. I'm motivated to join a team where I can learn from senior engineers and contribute to production code.'"
Q2,Why do you want to work here as an entry software developer?,"Shows company research, alignment with role, and growth mindset. Example: 'I want to work here because your product tackles developer productivity, which I care about. I appreciate your engineering values (code review, testing) and mentorship programs. As an entry-level developer, I can bring energy and a willingness to learn while contributing with my recent project experience in your stack.'"
Q3,Tell me about a technical challenge you faced and how you solved it.,"Use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result. Be specific about tools, measurements, and lessons. Example: 'Our API timed out under load (S). I was responsible for improving response time (T). I profiled endpoints with a tracer, identified disk-write contention, implemented batched writes and caching (A). Result: 1.2s average latency reduced to 200ms and the service passed our load tests; I learned to measure before optimizing.'"
Q4,Describe a time you worked on a team and a conflict you handled.,"Demonstrate communication, compromise, and action. Example: 'We disagreed on a library choice (S). I proposed short spikes for both options and created a comparison doc (A). After testing, we selected the option that minimized integration cost and met performance needs (R). The approach resolved the conflict and kept the project on schedule.'"
Q5,How do you keep your technical skills up to date?,"Shows consistent habits and curiosity. Example: 'I combine structured learning (online courses, RFCs), practice (coding exercises, side projects), and community (blogs, newsletters). I track new tools in a notes file and apply them in small features so learning is hands-on.'"
Q6,Walk me through how you would debug a bug that intermittently crashes a service.,"Structured troubleshooting steps and focus on reproducibility and observability. Example: '1) Attempt to reproduce locally; 2) Gather logs, metrics, and recent deploys; 3) Increase logging or add feature flags to isolate; 4) Create a minimal reproducer and write a failing test; 5) Implement a fix, run tests and staged rollout, monitor metrics post-deploy. Emphasize safe rollbacks and communication.'"
Q7,Where do you see yourself in five years?,"Shows ambition tied to learning and contribution. Example: 'In five years I'd aim to be a reliable mid-level engineer owning services end-to-end, mentoring juniors, and influencing architecture decisions. I want measurable growth â€” for example, leading projects that improve a key product metric.'"
